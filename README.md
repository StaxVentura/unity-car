# unity-car
Drive a car and smash through obstacles and enemies using the Unity engine. If the player accidentally falls off the road, they will respawn and be reset upon reaching the goal. Additionally, players can toggle between a third-person and first-person perspective by pressing the "F" key.

You will need [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and its Editor (both are free) to play and have fun :)
